The simcat ethos 
================

Welcome to *simcat*, a python package for implementing a machine-learning based method for inferring ancient introgression on species trees. *simcat* uses the phylogenomic simulator *ipcoal* to automate the task of generating large databases of training and testing data. 

*simcat* accomplishes two main tasks: simulation and inference. Simulation is to generate training databases that encompass the range of possible introgression scenarios, given a species tree and a range of parameters. Inference is performed by showing this training database to a user-defined machine learning model, which can then be applied to empirical data.


Our goals
---------
- Accessible: Easy to install and easy to use, with documentation and cookbooks.
- Reproducible: Designed for interactive use in Jupyter notebooks.
- Didactic: We provide (binder) notebooks for teaching in a classroom.
- Transparent: Read our code and make it your own.
