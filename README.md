# simcat

Machine learning for inferring introgressive edges. Given an input species tree, *simcat* automates the simulation of a SNP data training database and simplifies the process of training a neural network on that data and applying it to empirical SNP data.

See simcat_tutorial.ipynb in the "notebooks" folder for a walkthrough.  

*In development. Please email p.mckenzie@columbia.edu with any questions / feature requests.*
