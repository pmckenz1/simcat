# simcat

Python package for applying machine learning to infer ancient introgression on a species tree. Given an input species tree, *simcat* automates the simulation of a SNP data training database and simplifies the process of training a neural network on that data and applying it to empirical SNP data.

To install, clone this repo and install with `pip`.

See simcat_tutorial.ipynb in the "notebooks" folder for a walkthrough.  

*In development. Please email p.mckenzie@columbia.edu with any questions / feature requests.*
